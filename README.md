# CS 4613 Mini-Checkers Game

This project was an assignment in CS 4613 Artificial Intelligence, a course at
the NYU Tandon School of Engineering in the spring semester of 2018 with
Professor Ed K. Wong. It employs the minimax algorithm to play a simplified
variant of checkers.

Read the [project directions](Project-%20Checkers%20_CS%204613-6613%20Spr%2018_.pdf),
which specifies the requirements of the project and outlines the rules for this
variant of checkers.

Read my [writeup](Writeup%20of%20Mini-Checkers%20Game.pdf), which includes how to run
the game and explains how the heuristic function, which is used in the minimax
algorithm, works.
